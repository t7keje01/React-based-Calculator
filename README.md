# React-based-Calculator
This repository was created to contain the Calculator app that was done to complete a graded task on Coursera.  This was the first React-based app I've created!

To make this work on your computer, it needs the node_modules folder reinstalled. To do this, just use 'npm install' on your terminal (that's already on the correct directory). Afterwards use the 'npm start' to start the app!
